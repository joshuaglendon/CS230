        text: "Biology, defined as the scientific study of life, is an incredibly broad and diverse field. In many ways, it's as kaleidoscopic and rich as living organisms themselves. Biologists study life at many scales, from cells to organisms to entire ecosystems. Begin your own biological journey here!",

        text: "Physics is the study of the basic principles that govern the physical world around us. We'll start by looking at motion itself. Then, we'll learn about forces, momentum, energy, and other concepts in lots of different physical situations. To get the most out of physics, you'll need a solid understanding of algebra and a basic understanding of trigonometry.",

This may be your first time taking chemistry, but chances are you know a lot of chemistry already from observing the world around you. We will learn how to explain phenomena by thinking in terms of the atoms that make up all matter, and how atoms interact. Basically, learning chemistry is like having telescopic vision!",
